The below will be how to set up the git repo and everything but i am adding how to run the controllers and do api calls to check if everything is working in backend properly.I have added an extra file db.py because the previous structure was causing a loop between the files.Everything else is the same as Yathin had updated before for the database except for the changes i made in routes.py and the new file controllers.py for the logic.

How to run?
open integrated terminal in directory of backend 
then install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
then python run.py

After that we install extension of Rapid API client and follow below instructions:

For context i will be using Rapid API client as an extension in VS code for this.

for parent registration i have the route: ​http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/parent_register so i will paste this on to the sapce given in the extension then select the required method(post) and send a json body.

the body i used:

{"name":"ub",
"email":"ub@gmail.com",
"password":"abc",
"profile_image":""}

and then evaluate whether the correct status code and message are being displayed or not. 

for children registration the route used: http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/children_register

the body used:
{
  "name":"ubb",
  "email": "ub123@gmail.com",
  "password": "abcdef",
  "username": "ubbbbbbb",
  "dob": "2009-09-09",
  "school": "sphs",
  "profile_image": ""
}

How to run the tests?
You need to have pytest installed for this.Once its installed you can just go to the terminal and type pytest and it will run all the required test.But if you want to run any specific test(function) then type :
pytest test_auth.py -k test_parent_register_success


How to check the /auth/get_user?
Open rapid api/any other api client select GET method,write the correct url in the box:​http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/get_user 
on top go to headers then in header name add Authorisation and beside that take any session id that is in the data base and add Bearer before it and add that then send teh request.
for example: Authorisation(in header name)  Bearer 2b72599a-6aa7-4cdc-9120-0ad4fab2aef3 (in header value) then see if its giving correct info or not.

Remember admin cannot be fetched in this url it is onluy for parents and children.
similarly check the /child_dashboard_stats and /skill_categories.


Dummy data has been added to seed_data.py and run once to add to database.

Ok now we get into admin routes.
We have token authorization as well.So we have to go to the Headers place sand add Authorisation then beside that Bearer 646a02d0-1cab-4564-9051-7eef7ebe0d0f  .
Create new activities:  First go to the route  ​http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/activity sand select POST. 
Send this body in JSON:

{
    "title": "test",
    "description": "abc",
    "image": "",
    "instructions": "1,2,3",
    "difficulty": "Med",
    "answer_format": "text"
}
