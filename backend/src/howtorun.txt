The below will be how to set up the git repo and everything but i am adding how to run the controllers and do api calls to check if everything is working in backend properly.I have added an extra file db.py because the previous structure was causing a loop between the files.Everything else is the same as Yathin had updated before for the database except for the changes i made in routes.py and the new file controllers.py for the logic.

How to run?
open integrated terminal in directory of backend 
then install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
then python run.py

After that we install extension of Rapid API client and follow below instructions:

For context i will be using Rapid API client as an extension in VS code for this.

for parent registration i have the route: â€‹http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/parent_register so i will paste this on to the sapce given in the extension then select the required method(post) and send a json body.

the body i used:

{"name":"ub",
"email_id":"ub@gmail.com",
"password":"abc",
"profile_image":""}

and then evaluate whether the correct status code and message are being displayed or not. 

for children registration the route used: http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/children_register

the body used:
{
  "name":"ubb",
  "email_id": "ub123@gmail.com",
  "password": "abcdef",
  "username": "ubbbbbbb",
  "dob": "2009-09-09",
  "school": "sphs",
  "profile_image": ""
}

How to run the tests?
You need to have pytest installed for this.Once its installed you can just go to the terminal and type pytest and it will run all the required test.But if you want to run any specific test(function) then type :
pytest test_auth.py -k test_parent_register_success
